# NeuRAG — retrieval workflow

## What you lose by not searching

Worth stating plainly, because the failure is invisible from the inside. The
vault holds **this user's** documents, notes and code. Answer from training data
instead and you answer about somebody else's version of the subject — their
config, their schema, their decisions, replaced by the average of everyone
else's. That answer reads exactly like a good one. It is confident, fluent, and
about the wrong codebase, and the user has no way to tell without checking.

The cost of searching is one round-trip. The cost of not searching, on a
question the vault could have answered, is an answer that is wrong in a way
neither of you can see. That asymmetry is the whole argument: when in doubt,
search — and when the vault is empty or the topic is plainly general knowledge,
do not, because a search that cannot succeed is pure latency.

The knowledge base is a hierarchical graph of **nodes** (topics) holding
**chunks** (the text). Retrieval is hybrid: vector similarity when an embedding
model is available, lexical otherwise. Both paths return the same shape, so the
workflow below does not change with the tier.

## The loop

1. **Search before answering** when the question touches indexed material:
   `knowledge_query(query)`. Prefer it over answering from memory — the vault is
   the user's own material and outranks anything you recall.
2. **Cite what you used.** Name the node/chunk you drew from. An uncited answer
   is indistinguishable from a guess, and the user cannot check it.
3. **Widen only if empty.** No hits → `knowledge_tree` shows what the vault
   actually holds; re-query with the vocabulary it uses. Re-running the same
   words never helps.

## When NOT to search

Searching a vault that cannot answer costs a round-trip and buries the reply in
irrelevant chunks. Skip it for:

- procedural turns (ack, thanks, yes/no);
- general knowledge that is not in the user's material;
- anything you can answer from the current conversation.

`knowledge_status` tells you whether the vault is even populated. An empty vault
means every query is a wasted call — say so once, do not keep searching.

## Writing to the vault

Documents, not code: `knowledge_ingest` takes `.md .txt .pdf .docx` by default
(`code=true` for a tree that really is the knowledge). A chunk of source is a
stale, cut copy of what the model reads exact from disk; the vault keeps the
WHY — docs, decisions, history.

Announced tools are the index's: `knowledge_query`, `knowledge_ingest` (+
`_status`), `knowledge_status`, `knowledge_tree`, `knowledge_confirm`. The
graph and surgery tools below (`add_node`, `add_chunks`, `index`, `health`,
`neighbors`, `related`, `link_graph`, `rebuild_links`, `reindex`, `rename` /
`remove_node`, `import`) still work by name — via the CLI, Gray-Matter, or with
`NEURAG_TOOLS=all` — they are just not published to the model by default.

- `knowledge_add_node(name, parent, triggers)` — a topic. `triggers` are the
  phrases that should surface it; pick words the user would actually type, not
  synonyms you invented.
- `knowledge_add_chunks(node, chunks)` — the text under a topic. Chunks want to
  be self-contained: a chunk that only makes sense next to its neighbour will be
  retrieved alone and read alone.
- `knowledge_ingest(path)` — a whole folder OR a single document; poll
  `knowledge_ingest_status`. Re-ingesting a file REPLACES its chunks, so
  updating a document is just calling it again. Prefer it over
  `knowledge_index` + `knowledge_add_chunks`: it never moves chunk text through
  your context, which is the difference between one call and a hundred.

Do not paste secrets, tokens or credentials into a chunk. The vault is plain
text on disk and is surfaced verbatim into future conversations.

## Keeping it honest

`knowledge_health` is a read-only audit: broken hierarchy, duplicate names,
tiny/empty chunks, orphan nodes, chunks with no source. It flags, never deletes.
Run it after a bulk ingest — that is when structure breaks quietly.

## Paired with Neuron

When Gray Matter is the gateway, memory (Neuron) and knowledge (NeuRAG) are both
behind one connector. They answer different questions:

- **memory** — what was said, decided, learned in past turns (`pre_turn`/`store_turn`);
- **knowledge** — what the user's documents say (`knowledge_query`).

A question about a past decision is memory. A question about indexed material is
knowledge. When both apply, `gray_matter_pulse(topic)` merges them in one call.
